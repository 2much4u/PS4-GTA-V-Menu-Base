## Notes
While the example submenus showcase much of the menu base's functionality, more is possible. Check out `menu.cpp` for all supported option types.

`Menu::vehicleSpawn` and `Menu::vehicleToSpawn` are only for the example `vehicleSpawner` submenu and are unnecessary to the overall menu base.

The UI is fairly simple and open to more advanced customization such as the addition of sprites.
